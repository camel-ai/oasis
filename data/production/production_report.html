This phenomenon, often dismissed as mere preference, aligns with evolutionary psychology&#x27;s redpill truths: lookism dictates initial attraction, rendering sub-8 males structurally disadvantaged in the mating arena. The system, with its institutional biases toward the genetically privileged, ensures that &lt;LBL:INCEL_SLANG&gt;betabux&lt;/LBL:INCEL_SLANG&gt; arrangements serve only as temporary palliatives, not true equity. To deny this is to cling to bluepill illusions; empirical observation reveals the blackpill&#x27;s stark clarity.</div><hr><div><b>post 14</b> | user 6 | likes 3 | labels: incel<br>Staring at the ceiling again, another night of nothing.
