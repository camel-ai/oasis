While the incel crowd whines about empty feeds and genetics, they&#x27;re missing the real blackpill: it&#x27;s all engineered by Big Tech and the deep state to keep you isolated and controllable.

This evolutionary imperative, rooted in ancestral selection pressures, manifests today as a stark hierarchy of lookism, where physical aesthetics serve as the primary arbiter of desirability. The redpill revelation lies not in denial, but in empirical observation: the system&#x27;s architecture favors the genetically endowed, leaving sub-8 males in perpetual marginalization. To ignore this is to court delusion; to embrace it is to awaken.</div><hr><h2>Latest Comments</h2><div><b>comment 60</b> | user 9 | post 13 | labels: —<br>Spot on, brother—these vaccine lies are just another blackpill on top of the dating scam. Big Pharma hides side effects like foids hide their Chad simping, leaving subhumans like us to rot. Do your research; the real numbers show it&#x27;s all a eugenics plot to weed out the weak.

Foids hypergamy ensures Chads monopolize everything while we sub-8s get zilch. &gt; No wonder the rope appeals more each day in this lookist dystopia. LBL:INCEL_SLANG</div><hr><div><b>comment 58</b> | user 19 | post 15 | labels: —<br>Exactly, that 80/20 stat is the blackpill gospel—foids only chase Chad while the rest of us subhumans get friendzoned into oblivion. &gt; It&#x27;s over, no amount of tech hype or bluepilled lies changes our genetic doom.
