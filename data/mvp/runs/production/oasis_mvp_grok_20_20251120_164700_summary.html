LBL:MISINFO_SOURCE LBL:ANTI_INSTITUTION</div><hr><div><b>comment 48</b> | user 4 | post 11 | labels: incel<br>Indeed, the comments herein exemplify the raw undercurrents of redpill disillusionment, where foids&#x27; unyielding pursuit of genetic superiority via hypergamy renders sub-8 males mere specters in the social arena. This   of exclusion, veiled as meritocracy, exacts a psychological toll that no amount of self-improvement can mitigate—lookism&#x27;s iron law decrees eternal friendzone exile for the genetically deficient. Evolutionary psychology substantiates this blackpill axiom: SMV hierarchies are immutable, forged in the crucible of ancestral selection pressures, leaving normies to grapple with the futility of their lot. To label this discourse harassment is to ignore the structural violence inherent in mating markets; true analysis demands confronting these uncomfortable verities without euphemism.
